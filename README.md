# `Agents in a Trivial Vacuum Environment`
This project involves installing and running the aima code. Within the agents.py module, we take a look at the ReflexVacuumAgent class:

```
def ReflexVacuumAgent ():
"""
[ Figure 2.8]
A reflex agent for the two - state vacuum environment .
>>> agent = ReflexVacuumAgent()
>>> environment = TrivialVacuumEnvironment()
>>> environment.add_thing(agent)
>>> environment.run()
>>> environment.status == {(1 ,0):’Clean’ , (0,0) : ’Clean’}
True
"""
```
Loading in agent.py using the interactive python interpreter, there are comments available which show the commands you can use to 
- create a ReflexVacuumAgent object
- create an environment for it
- then run it in the environment

To run the agent in that environment for a limited amount of time, pass an integer in as a parameter in the
environment.run call (e.g. environment.run(50))

This applies for other agents such as the model based vacuum agent and the random vacuum agent.

## Reflex Vacuum Agent
• Here we run the ReflexVacuumAgent in the TrivialVacuumEnvironment for 15 steps and use the
TraceAgent class to print out its perceptions and actions at each time step. Following that, we can return
the environment status:
```
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Dirty') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
Reflex:  {(0, 0): 'Clean', (1, 0): 'Clean'}
```

## Model Based Vacuum Agent
• Here we run the ModelBasedVacuumAgent in the TrivialVacuumEnvironment for 15 steps and
use the TraceAgent class to print out its perceptions and actions at each time step. Following that, 
we can return the environment status:
```
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Dirty') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
Model:  {(0, 0): 'Clean', (1, 0): 'Clean'}
```

## Random Vacuum Agent
• Here we run the RandomVacuumAgent agent in the TrivialVacuumEnvironment for 15 steps and 
use the TraceAgent class to print out its perceptions and actions at each time step. Following that,
we return the environment status:
```
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does NoOp
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((0, 0), 'Clean') and does Right
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Suck
<Agent> perceives ((1, 0), 'Clean') and does Left
Random:  {(0, 0): 'Clean', (1, 0): 'Clean'}
```

## Compare Agents
• We use the compare_agents function to compare the three agents in the trivial environment. Within the code, we return the results of the comparison.
```
Compare:  [(<function ModelBasedVacuumAgent at 0x11f98f5b0>, 9), (<function RandomVacuumAgent at 0x11f98f400>, -485.7), (<function ReflexVacuumAgent at 0x11f98f520>, -989)]
```
